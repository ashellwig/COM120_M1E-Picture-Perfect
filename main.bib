Celeste Headlee has worked as a radio host for decades, and she knows the ingredients of a great conversation: Honesty, brevity, clarity and a healthy amount of listening. In this insightful talk, she shares 10 useful rules for having better conversations. "Go out, talk to people, listen to people," she says. "And, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed."},

	abstract = {Interpersonal communication ({IC}) is a continuous game between the interacting interactants. It is a give and take - a continuous, dynamic flow that is linguistically realized as discourse as an on-going sequence of interactants'moves. Interpersonal communication is produced and interpreted by acting linguistically, and this makes it a fascinating research area. The handbook, Interpersonal Communication, examines how interactants manage to exchange facts, ideas, views, opinions, beliefs, emotion, etc. by using the linguistic systems and the resources they offer. In interpersonal communication, the fine-tuning of individuals'use of the linguistic resources is continuously probed. The language used in interpersonal communication enhances social relations between interactants and keeps the interaction on the normal track. When interaction gets off the track, linguistic miscommunication may also destroy social relationships. This volume is essentially concerned with this fine-tuning in discourse, and how it is achieved among various interactant groups. The volume departs from the following fundamental questions: How do interpersonal relations manifest themselves in language? What is the role of language in developing and maintaining relationships in interpersonal communication? What types of problems occur in interpersonal communication and what kind of strategies and means are used to solve them? How does linguistically realized interpersonal communication interact with other semiotic modes? Interpersonal communication is seen and researched from the perspective of what is being said or written, and how it is realized in various generic forms. The current research also gives attention to other semiotic modes which interact with the linguistic modes. It is not just the social roles of interactants in groups, the possible media available, the non-verbal behaviors, the varying contextual frames for communication, but primarily the actual linguistic manifestations that we need to focus upon when we want to have a full picture of what is going on in human interpersonal communication. It is this linguistic perspective that the volume aims to present to all researchers interested in {IC}. The volume offers an overview of the theories, methods, tools, and resources of linguistically-oriented approaches, e.g. from the fields of linguistics, social psychology, sociology, and semiotics, for the purpose of integration and further development of the interests in {IC}., Topics e.g.: Orientation to interaction as primarily linguistically realized processes Expertise on theorizing and analyzing cultural and situational contexts where linguistic processes are realized Expertise on handling language corpora Expertise on theorizing and analyzing interaction types as genres Orientation to an integrated view of linguistic and non-linguistic participant activities and of how interactants generate meanings and interact with space Expertise on researching the management of the linguistic flow in interaction and its successfulness.},

	abstract = {Self-description research on athletes with intellectual disabilities ({ID}) is under investigated. The specific aims in this paper are (a) to identify the differences in physical self-concept and body image by Unified Sports experiences, and (b) to investigate predictors of physical self-concept. Participants included 89 Special Olympics athletes who had Unified Sports experiences ({USE}, n = 43) and those without {USE} (n = 46). Demographic, anthropometric, self-description data were collected during the questionnaire interview and physical examination. Analyses included descriptive and regression modeling to determine differences in the psychological attributes by {USE} and best subsets of predictors of each physical self-concept construct. The findings suggest that the participation of {USE} facilitated greater sport competence and there is no single predictor across the six physical self-concept constructs. The findings provide evidence that sports participation may have positive impacts on physical self-concept toward athletes with {ID}.},

	abstract = {Defines the self-concept as a set of cognitive structures (self-schemas) that provide for individual expertise in particular social domains. Two studies were conducted with 62 male undergraduates with self-reported masculinity schemas (schematics) and 58 male undergraduates without schemas (aschematics) to examine the information-processing consequences of this expertise for the perception of others. Ss viewed a film and were required to unitize the film into segments, describe the actor, and recall the actor's behavior. Findings show that, in the unitizing task, schematics consistently divided a schema-relevant film about another person into larger units than did aschematics. In reconstructing the film sequence, schematics made more global conjectures about the personality and motivation of the target individual, implying an instance of expert performance, in which the self-schema provided the schematics with an interpretive framework for organizing the schema-relevant behavior of others. When given instructions to attend to the details of behavior, schematics made smaller units, whereas the performance of the aschematics did not vary. The role of the self-concept in the perception of others is seen to vary systematically with whether self or other is the cognitive reference point and the conditions associated with each are delineated.
